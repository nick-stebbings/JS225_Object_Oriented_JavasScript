// A stack is a compound data type like an array. The difference between an array and a stack is that in an array you can insert and remove elements in any order you want, but a stack has a rule whereby you can only add new elements at the end and remove the last inserted element.

// Create a function newStack, that 
//  -- when called returns a stack object with three methods:
  //  -- push takes a value and inserts it at the end of the stack. 
  //  -- pop removes the last element from the stack. 
  //  -- printStack logs each remaining element of the stack on its own line.

// -- Requirements:
//    - Internally, use an array to implement the stack. Make sure that the array is not accessible from outside the methods.
//    - As per the forum post, try to implement in three different ways:

// 1 - PseudoClassical

// 2 - OLOO
