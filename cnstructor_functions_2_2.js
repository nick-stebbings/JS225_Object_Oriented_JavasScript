// Since a constructor is just a function, it can be called without the new operator, and this can lead to unexpected results and errors especially for inexperienced programmers.

// Write a constructor function that can be used with or without the new operator, and return the same result in either form. Use the code below to check your solution:

function User(first, last) {
  if(this.constructor !== User) {
    return new User(first, last)
  }
  this.name = first + ' ' + last
}

let name = 'Jane Doe';
let user1 = new User('John', 'Doe');
let user2 = User('John', 'Doe');

console.log(name);         // => Jane Doe
console.log(user1.name);   // => John Doe
console.log(user2.name);   // => John Doe
